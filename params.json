{"name":"Argonaut","tagline":"Robotics & Cloud Processing Experiments","body":"This project centers around robotics using a mobile robot platform (the Pixy Pet Robot), and Windows IoT Core running on a Raspberry Pi 2.\r\n\r\nThe long term goals are to mesh local on-device algorithms with cloud-based machine learning models to give mobile robots the ability to navigate their environment better over time. \r\n\r\nOn-device experiments center around sensor data collection and fast feedback loops to allow reactive behaviours; cloud-based experiments will look at sensor fusion, perceptual and cognitive models which can help the robot make sense of what it perceives and make smarter decisions to achieve its goals.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
